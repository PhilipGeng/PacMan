<h2>Read me page for pac-man project</h2>
<h3>submitted by GENG XU 12132031d</h3>
<ul><h3>project feature:</h3>
<li>1. random generated map: Standard pac-man map generated by algorithm, thousands of maps will bring you a complete new game every time</li>
<li>2. control mode: Keyboard direction keys can be used to control pacman. Mouse click on map can move pac-man to destination with shortest path by path finding algorithm</li>
<li>3. pause and resume: click outside the playboard will pause the game</li>
<li>4. ghosts with different characteristics: the possibility that at each time the ghost decide to chase after the pac-man is different. There will be one aggressive ghost, two normal ghost and one idle ghost.</li>
<li>5. different size: provide 25*25 map and 40*40 map</li>
</ul>
<ul><h3>This project is designed for rehabilitation training for dyslexia patients</h3>
	<p>The main idea to rehabilitate dyslexia patients is to train them to concentrate their attention when doing specific things.</p>
<li>1. The map of every new game will be completely new and complex. Players can judge their behaviour without the influence of previous game in their memory. This will make sure the rehabilitation is efficient.</li>
<li>2. Two different control modes allow user to think differently when they are controlling the pac-man. This is to distract their concentration to force them play with attention. </li>
<li>3. The animation video game itself is a good rehabilitation training for the disease. Rapid moving pac-man and rapid chasing ghosts will all force the players to concentrate their attention or they will die. </li>
